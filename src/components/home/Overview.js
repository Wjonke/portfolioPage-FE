				NodeJS with Express, ReactJS and vanilla HTML, CSS, and
				JavaScript, as well as AWS and Azure services. I am also an
				experienced Project Manager overseeing both digital and physical

				actionable tasks, while communicating with stakeholders along
				way, acting as a bridge between teams, to ensure their vision is
				realized, realistically and accurately. I also enjoy fishing,
				gardening, fermentation projects, and I have a real soft spot
