## A little about the project

### Description

#### This app was developed as my own personal portfolio site. I created a backend for it to hold project data just as an additional exercise. I debated using the github api and a screenshot api, but for this iteration I decided to build out my own API. That can be found here [here](https://github.com/Wjonke/PortfolioBackend 'Portfolio backend'). Its a constand work in progress so I would love to hear some feedback!
